# Facial Expression Recognition Demo

An end-to-end deep learning and computer vision project for facial expression recognition.

This project predicts one of seven facial expressions from face images and includes a complete AI application pipeline: dataset inspection, PyTorch data loading, CNN baselines, transfer learning with ResNet18, training and validation, detailed evaluation, model saving/loading, single-image prediction, OpenCV face detection, Streamlit demo, and pytest-based automated tests.

The goal of this project is not to claim state-of-the-art performance, but to build a complete, explainable, reproducible AI application that can be shown on GitHub, discussed in interviews, and extended into real-time computer vision applications.

---

## Project Overview

The project classifies facial expressions into seven categories:

* angry
* disgust
* fear
* happy
* neutral
* sad
* surprise

Input format:

```text
grayscale image
48x48 pixels
tensor shape: [batch_size, 1, 48, 48]
```

Model output format:

```text
logits shape: [batch_size, 7]
```

The project started with a simple CNN baseline and was gradually improved with validation/test split, data augmentation, ImprovedCNN, transfer learning with ResNet18, robust prediction outputs, and OpenCV-based face crop support.

## Dataset

This project is designed for a FER2013-style facial expression dataset organized as image folders.

Expected local dataset structure:

```text
data/raw/
├── train/
│   ├── angry/
│   ├── disgust/
│   ├── fear/
│   ├── happy/
│   ├── neutral/
│   ├── sad/
│   └── surprise/
└── test/
    ├── angry/
    ├── disgust/
    ├── fear/
    ├── happy/
    ├── neutral/
    ├── sad/
    └── surprise/
```

The dataset is not committed to GitHub because image datasets are usually large.

---

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Environment Check

Run:

```powershell
python -m src.environment_check
```

This checks whether the main Python dependencies can be imported successfully.

---

## Dataset Inspection

Run:

```powershell
python -m src.inspect_dataset
```

This checks:

* train/test folder structure
* emotion class folders
* image counts
* sample image mode
* sample image size

Expected sample image format:

```text
mode: L
size: (48, 48)
```

---

## Train the Model

Run:

```powershell
python -m src.train
```

The training script supports multiple model choices in code:

```python
model_name = "simple_cnn"
model_name = "improved_cnn"
model_name = "resnet18"
```

For ResNet18 transfer learning:

```python
model_name = "resnet18"
use_pretrained = True
```

The training pipeline:

```text
Dataset
↓
Train / validation / test split
↓
Data augmentation on training set
↓
Model training
↓
Validation accuracy tracking
↓
Best model checkpoint saving
↓
Training history and curve saving
↓
Experiment result logging
```

Generated outputs include:

```text
outputs/models/
outputs/logs/training_history.json
outputs/logs/experiment_results.csv
outputs/figures/training_curves.png
```

---

## Model Comparison

A controlled experiment was run using the same validation split and training configuration.

| Model                 | Validation Accuracy |
| --------------------- | ------------------: |
| SimpleCNN             |              0.4142 |
| ImprovedCNN           |              0.4644 |
| ResNet18 from scratch |              0.4715 |
| Pretrained ResNet18   |              0.5078 |

The pretrained ResNet18 model achieved the best validation accuracy in this project.

This shows the value of transfer learning: instead of learning visual features from scratch, the model can reuse general image features learned from large-scale image data and fine-tune them for facial expression recognition.

---

## Detailed Evaluation

Run:

```powershell
python -m src.evaluate_detailed
```

This generates:

* overall accuracy
* classification report
* per-class precision, recall, and F1-score
* confusion matrix
* per-class accuracy

This is useful because overall accuracy alone can hide weak classes, especially when the dataset is imbalanced.

---

## Single Image Prediction

Run:

```powershell
python -m src.predict
```

The prediction output includes:

* predicted class
* confidence
* top-3 predictions
* low-confidence flag
* face crop status
* number of detected faces
* selected face box

Example output:

```text
Single image prediction
----------------------------------------
Use face crop: True
Face found: False
Number of faces: 0
Face box: None
Predicted class: happy
Confidence: 0.7702
Low confidence: False
Top predictions:
- happy: 0.7702
- angry: 0.0646
- neutral: 0.0569
```

If no face is detected, the system falls back to the original image instead of crashing.

---

## Streamlit Demo

Run:

```powershell
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

The web app allows users to:

* upload an image
* preview the uploaded image
* enable or disable face detection / face crop
* see whether a face was detected
* view the image used for prediction
* run emotion prediction
* see predicted emotion and confidence
* see top-3 prediction probabilities
* see a low-confidence warning when appropriate

---

## Face Detection and Face Crop

The project uses OpenCV Haar Cascade face detection.

The face crop pipeline is:

```text
Uploaded image
↓
OpenCV face detection
↓
Select largest detected face
↓
Add padding around face box
↓
Crop face region
↓
Resize to 48x48
↓
Run expression prediction
```

If no face is detected:

```text
No detected face
↓
Use original image as fallback
↓
Continue prediction
```

This makes the demo more robust for real-world uploaded images.

---

## Run Tests

Run all tests:

```powershell
python -m pytest
```

Current local test result:

```text

```

Current test coverage includes:

* environment check
* dataset inspection
* DataLoader output shape and split logic

## What I Learned

This project helped me practice:

* building a complete PyTorch image classification pipeline
* using train / validation / test split correctly
* comparing models with controlled experiments
* using transfer learning with ResNet18
* evaluating classification models beyond overall accuracy
* building a simple AI web demo with Streamlit
* adding OpenCV preprocessing before model inference
* writing pytest tests for machine learning project components
* organizing a project for GitHub and interview discussion

---

## Limitations

Current limitations:

* FER2013-style 48x48 grayscale images are low-resolution.
* Facial expression labels can be ambiguous.
* Some classes are harder due to imbalance and visual similarity.
* Haar Cascade face detection is simple and may fail on low-resolution or non-frontal faces.
* Softmax confidence is not a fully calibrated probability.
* The project focuses on building a complete applied AI pipeline rather than achieving state-of-the-art performance.

---

## Possible Future Improvements

Possible future improvements include:

* use a stronger face detector
* add face alignment
* train for more epochs
* tune learning rate and batch size
* improve class imbalance handling
* add model selection in the Streamlit interface
* deploy the Streamlit demo online
* extend the project to webcam-based real-time prediction
* combine expression recognition with attention-state estimation

---

## Project Status

Version 1.0 completed.

The project now supports a complete facial expression recognition workflow from dataset loading to model training, evaluation, robust prediction, face crop preprocessing, web demo, and automated tests.
